In the end every grave goes unvisited 

If I am I because you are you, and you are you because I am I, then I am not I and you are not you. In other words, we are not separate. We define each other. We're all backs and fronts to each other. The real you is not a puppet which life pushes around. The real deep down you is the whole universe. Under all explicit opposition, there is implicit unity. 

We resist change ignorant of the fact that change is life and that nothing is invariably the obverse face of something. So space, night, death, darkness, not being there is an essential component of being there. This organism is a continuous energy with everything else that is going on. Everybody is fundamental. The ultimate reality. Not God in a politically kingly sense, but God in the sense of being the self, the deep down basic whatever there is. And you are all that. Only you are pretending you are not.

“We can rest contentedly in our sins and in our stupidities; and anyone who has watched gluttons shoveling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating, will admit that we can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world. A bad man, happy, is a man without the least inkling that his actions do not "answer", that they are not in accord with the laws of the universe.” -CS Lewis
