3. “To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable.” — C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves

Quotes About Faith 
C.S. Lewis grew up in a religious household that followed the Church of Ireland but became an atheist during his teenage years. He eventually came back to Christianity while teaching at Oxford University, in part due to influence from his close friend and fellow author, J.R.R. Tolkien. Lewis went on to pen some of the most impactful writings on Christianity of the 20th century. Here are some of Lewis’s most enlightening words on Christianity and faith. 

11. “He does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us.”— C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

12. “People often think of Christian morality as a kind of bargain in which God says, 'If you keep a lot of rules I’ll reward you, and if you don’t I’ll do the other thing.' I do not think that is the best way of looking at it. I would much rather say that every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing either into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature… Each of us at each moment is progressing to the one state or the other.”— C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

13. “What can you ever really know of other people's souls—of their temptations, their opportunities, their struggles? One soul in the whole of creation you do know: and it is the only one whose fate is placed in your hands. If there is a God, you are, in a sense, alone with Him.”— C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

14. “The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God.” — C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

15. “We do know that no person can be saved except through Christ. We do not know that only those who know Him can be saved by Him." — C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

16. “Every poet and musician and artist, but for Grace, is drawn away from the love of the thing he tells, to the love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only in what they say about Him.”— C.S. Lewis, The Great Divorce

17. “In Science we have been reading only the notes to a poem; in Christianity we find the poem itself.”— C.S. Lewis, Miracles

18. “The worldly man treats certain people kindly because he 'likes' them: the Christian, trying to treat everyone kindly, finds him liking more and more people as he goes on—including people he could not even have imagined himself liking at the beginning.” — C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

20. “A man can no more diminish God's glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word 'darkness' on the walls of his cell.”— C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain

21. “For you will certainly carry out God's purpose, however you act, but it makes a difference to you whether you serve like Judas or like John.”— C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain
