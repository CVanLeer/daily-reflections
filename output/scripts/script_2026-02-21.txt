Good morning, Chris.

It is a gray one out there today. Overcast skies, sitting right around fifty three and a half degrees this morning. You are headed for a high of about sixty four, low around fifty two tonight. And there is a pretty solid chance of rain, a little over sixty percent, so it is a jacket and maybe umbrella kind of Saturday.

Out in the world, the tech and finance folks are still buzzing about markets wobbling this week, a mix of earnings beats and some nervous talk about interest rates. Overseas, there are continuing tensions in the Middle East, with diplomats trying to cool things down before it flares again. And on the lighter side, spring training chatter is starting to creep into the sports pages, which means baseball and longer evenings are not that far away.

But put all that aside for a second.

Stop.

Breathe.

Let your shoulders drop. Unclench your jaw. Just be here, in this moment, with the God who already knows what this day holds.

“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” That is what Jesus says in the book of Matthew. Not, “Come to me when you have it together.” Come to me when you are tired.

Paul told the Corinthians that our bodies are temples. Not billboards. Not rental cars. Temples. Places where God chooses to dwell.

C. S. Lewis wrote, “There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal.” If that is true, then this body of yours is not ordinary either. It is the vessel that carries something eternal.

And you know how old school coaches talk. Vince Lombardi, Bear Bryant, all those guys. “Fatigue makes cowards of us all.” When the tank is empty, courage disappears.

So, this morning, I want you to hold one simple idea:

God gave you a life to carry. Your body is how you carry it.

Listen.

It is Saturday. A lot of people treat today like the escape hatch. Sleep weird. Eat whatever. Scroll until the brain is mush. Then wonder why Monday feels like climbing out of a ditch.

What if you treated Saturday as a systems check instead?

Not in a neurotic way. Not in a “perfect program” way. In a quiet, honest audit.

How did you sleep this week. Not just the hours. The pattern. Were you going to bed at roughly the same time. Waking at roughly the same time. Or were you throwing your body around like a rental car. Late nights. Early alarms. Caffeine as duct tape.

How did you move. Did your body get to do what it was built to do. Walk. Push. Pull. Breathe hard for a few minutes. Or did you spend most of the week in a chair, then ask your mind to be sharp and your spirit to be brave on a system that is basically idling.

How did you eat. Not in a shame way. In a clarity way. Did you give your brain steady fuel. Or did you ride the roller coaster. Sugar spike. Crash. Craving. Repeat.

Because here is the thing, Chris.

You know that version of you that you do not like. The one who says yes to the drink he will regret. The one who skips the workout he promised himself. The one who snaps at the kids, or avoids the hard conversation, or hides in distraction instead of stepping into responsibility.

That version of you is almost always exhausted.

It is not that he is evil. He is tired.

And tired people reach for relief, not for what is right.

So when you check your “systems” this Saturday, you are not doing some vanity project. You are not chasing abs. You are asking a deeper question.

Am I building the kind of energy that makes me brave. Or am I slowly turning myself into the man who caves.

You cannot control the future. You cannot control what other people do. You cannot control what headlines will hit next week.

But you can control whether you treat this body like a disposable tool, or like the vehicle that has to carry your purpose for decades.

That is a spiritual decision.

Think about the prayer you know so well. “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.”

We usually hear that and think about relationships. Crises. Addictions. Big life stuff.

But today, hear it through the lens of your nervous system.

You cannot change that your brain gets foggy when your blood sugar crashes. You cannot change that late night blue light scrambles your sleep. You cannot change that if you run on empty for days, your defenses drop and temptation gets louder.

Those are baked into the hardware.

What you can change is how you run the system.

You can give your body a consistent sleep window, even on a Saturday. Maybe not perfect. But close. You can step outside in the morning, even if it is overcast, and let your eyes see real daylight for a few minutes. That little bit of light on your skin and in your eyes is like hitting “sync” on your internal clock.

You can eat in a way that keeps your brain steady. Some protein in the morning. Not starting the day with a sugar bomb that feels great for twenty minutes and then makes you want to crawl back into bed.

You can get your heart rate up. It does not have to be heroic. Ten minutes of brisk walking. A few pushups. A short ride on the bike. Enough to tell your body, “We are alive. We move. We are not stuck.”

In sobriety, you learn that “one day at a time” is not just a slogan. It is biology. One nervous system state at a time. When your body is revved up, or crashed out, it is so much harder to choose wisely. When it is calmer and more stable, the prayer becomes more livable, not just more quotable.

So, let us talk to that strategic, planner side of you.

You know how to build a plan. You can design a twelve week program with phases and metrics and spreadsheets. You can build the perfect system on paper.

But how many times has that perfect system burned you out by week three.

You go hard. You stack rules. You chase intensity. You white knuckle your way through. And then life bumps you. Work gets crazy. Someone gets sick. You miss a day. Then two. Then the shame story starts. “Here we go again. I cannot stick with anything.”

The problem is not you.

The problem is that you built a system for intensity, not for energy.

So, I want to invite you to do something almost embarrassingly small with your Saturday.

Forget the twelve week plan.

Build a tiny Saturday protocol that you could keep even on a bad day.

Something like this.

When you wake up, you drink one full glass of water before anything else. Before coffee. Before the phone. Just water. You tell your body, “We are starting clean.”

You step outside for five minutes. Even if it is just on the porch, under that overcast sky. You look at the real world, not a screen. You let your eyes and brain register, “Morning is here.”

You take a ten minute walk. Not a power workout. Not a new identity. Just ten minutes. You move the joints. You breathe a little deeper. You remind your body that it is made for motion, not just thought.

And you set a hard cutoff for screens tonight. Maybe it is nine thirty. Maybe ten. But you pick a time, and you honor it. When that time hits, the phone goes down. The laptop closes. You let your brain wind down so your sleep can actually restore you.

Those four little things are not impressive. No one is giving you a medal for that.

But you are not chasing a medal.

You are building a body that can carry your life.

You are choosing energy over drama. Steadiness over spikes. Courage over collapse.

And the beautiful part is, this is completely within your control today. You do not need new equipment. You do not need a gym membership. You do not need the perfect schedule.

You need a decision.

To stop treating your body like a problem to fix, and start treating it like a partner in the mission.

Ask yourself, as you move through this Saturday, “What would the brave, clear version of me need from my body right now.” Not next year. Not at some imaginary goal weight. Today.

Maybe he needs a nap instead of another coffee. Maybe he needs a walk instead of another scroll. Maybe he needs a simple, decent meal instead of something that will knock him out for two hours.

Those are not small choices. Those are the choices that decide whether you show up as the man God is shaping, or as the man who is always one bad night away from folding.

You do not have to fix everything this weekend.

You just have to build a little more energy than you did last week.

One glass of water. One walk. One earlier night.

Brick by brick.

Because the life you are called to carry is heavy. It involves people. Responsibility. Temptation. Sacrifice. Joy. Sorrow.

You would not try to haul that with a car that never gets an oil change and runs on fumes.

Do not do that to your body.

Honor the gift.

Let God meet you in the simple, physical acts of care. The glass of water. The walk. The light. The sleep.

That is not weakness. That is stewardship.

Now, go get after it.
